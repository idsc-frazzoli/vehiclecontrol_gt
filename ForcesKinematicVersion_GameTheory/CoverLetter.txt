Dear Editor,
We are pleased to submit the original manuscript "Social Optima are Nash 
Equilibria in Urban Driving Games" by A. Zanardi, E. Mion, S. Bolognani, 
A. Censi, E. Frazzoli for consideration for publication in IEEE Robotics
and Automation Letters.

In this manuscript, we describe Urban Driving Games (UDGs), a particular
class of differential games that model the interactions and incentives of
the urban driving task, in which drivers are self-interested but also
possess a “communal” interest, such as not colliding with each other.
We show that, in contrast with competitive scenarios like racing games, a 
wider range of road interactions can be modeled as potential games, which, 
in turn, provides existence and convergence guarantees for NE.
Moreover, it offers also a rational tool for equilibrium selection which 
minimizes the social cost.
This allows to prove several interesting properties, such as the
convergence of the iterated best response algorithm to a Nash Equilibrium
and the fact that the social optima (minimizers of the social welfare)
are Nash Equilibria, and that these equilibria can be found with an optimal
control approach.
Finally, an example with three vehicles approaching a 4-way intersection 
has been designed to apply the findings in a realistic driving scenario 
and prove the benefits of the social optima.

This article is our original unpublished work and it has not been submitted
to any other journal for reviews. We have no conflicts of interest to 
disclose.
We thank you in advance for your time. Please feel free to contact me in 
case of any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,
